    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I am Garrett Udstrand (<a href="mailto:udstr013@umn.edu">udstr013@umn.edu</a>).
      This is my website submission for Project 3 in CSCI 5611. The
      example video of the project can be viewed below.

    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>
      The project mainly features 
    </p>

    <h1>Project Features I Attempted</h1>
    <h2>Single Agent Navigation</h2>
    <p>
      Obviously, this one is required. The rockets are all navigating a
      cluttered, 2D environment. I use a PRM with A* to calculate the path, and
      then smooth the path as the space ships simulate the movement. I also cap
      the velocity and acceleration of the space ship at certain limits to make
      the movement look natural. Slow downs near corners also help make the
      movement look natural.
    </p>
    <h2>Improved Agent and Scene Rendering</h2>
    <p>
      I themed all the agents as space ships by using textured quads. I also
      rendered the obstacles as asteroids using textured quads. However, they
      have bounding spheres which are used for the collision and pathfinding
      calculations. These are also displayed in the simulation. The bounding
      geometry for the spaceship is the little force field around it and the
      bounding geometry for the asteroid is the little atmosphere around it
      (both are colored, transparent cirlces overlayed on top of their
      respective quad).
    </p>
    <h2>Orientation Smoothing</h2>
    <p>
      The agents are rendered as space ships and have a clear front and back.
      The front of the space ship (the nose of the rocket) is supposed to be
      pointing in the same direction the ship is moving, so it looks more like
      an actual rocket moving through space. The acceleration and velocity
      calculations from before result in smooth rotations of the agent, even if
      they can sometimes be fast.
    </p>
    <h2>Multiple Agents Planning</h2>
    <p>
      My simulation can support an arbitrary number of agents, though the
      example video is rendered with 10. They all get their own start positions
      and end goals, which they all plan separate paths for and then move to
      independently. I did not attempt the Crowd Simulation challenge, however,
      so the agents do not make an attempt to avoid each other.
    </p>

    <h1>Code</h1>
    <p>
      The simulation was written using
      <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a> and
      <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html"
        >PriorityQueue</a
      >
      from the <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> standard library. The
      test harness for this project was used as a base for creating the
      simulation, but it has been significantly modified. Almost none of the
      original code of the test harness remains.

    <h1>Difficulties</h1>
    <h2>A* With Arbitrary Start and Goal Positions</h2>
    <p>
      Implementing A* normally was not too problematic for me. You just roughly
      follow the pseudo code with your own logic and you end up with the proper
      results. But, the arbitrary start and goal positions meant that I had to
      slighly modify A* to get the results I wanted. While you can just add the
      start and goal positions as nodes in the PRM, and then re-generate the
      connections for the graph, that is really slow, and was not fast enough
      for the speeds required for this simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, my solution to get A* to work ultimately looked like the
      following. First, determine all the nodes that could be a neighbor of the
      start, and add them to the fringe (open set in A*). These nodes had to
      have the cost for going from the start to them added on initially, as
      well. Basically, instead of starting the algorithm with one node, we start
      the algorithm like we're already one step in, and we start with several
      nodes. Second, determine all the nodes that could be a neighbor of the
      goal and add them to a list of goal nodes. Third, whenever a goal node is
      encountered, add a node to the fringe with the proper cost to go to the
      goal, and an ID that marks it as the goal node. Finally, whenever a node
      is pulled off the fringe with the goal node ID, end the algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this works basically the same as how A* runs normally, but I
      avoided creating new nodes for the start and goal and regenerating all the
      edges in the graph. This sort of solution was kind of discussed in class,
      but even with the class discussion and my own understanding of the
      solution, it still took a while to debug and get it working.
    </p>
    <h2>Smooth and Collision Free Motion</h2>
    <p>
      Simulating smooth motion was not too difficult, as that is something we've
      covered in class and in class activities before. However, smooth, weighty
      motion that looks good is not very good at following a path. An agent with
      that sort of motion frequently overshoots corners, is forced to back track
      and hits obstacles. It took a lot of work and tinkering to figure out how
      to make motion that looks good and natural while still following the path
      for the most part. Ultimately, the fix that helped the most in making it
      happen was forcing the agent to slow to some minimum velocity when it
      reached corners. Thus, it could still have weighty movement, but it
      couldn't overshoot corners, which was the main problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also issues with the agent fidgeting and jiggling sporadically
      and randomly, but forcing the acceleration to be over some minimum amount
      and changing the renderer from the default to P2D fixed up most of those
      issues.
    </p>
    <h2>Texture Rendering</h2>
    <p>
      Processing loads images in as an array of pixels to then be rendered as
      textures or plain images. As can be imagined, large images have a lot of
      pixels and thus take a significant amount of processing power. I didn't
      realize this at first, and tried to load an image that was 3000 by 5000
      pixels. The performance was terrible and it took me a significant amount
      of time to figure out why. After that, resizing the image while
      maintaining a good resolution was a concern, but luckily Windows' Photos
      app was able to resize the image for me properly.
